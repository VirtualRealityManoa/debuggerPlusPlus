IDEAS:

Half way through the game you turn into the roach. You swap bodies. And suddenly you need to evade the human.
First level starts out in pitch black with the title: Mindful Murder
White text fades in. Out of focus. Blurry.
Then you hear someone go and turn on the light.
It flashes.
There are hundreds of them!
It goes out and there are half as many.
They are running away.
The light flickers on as the last few run away under the floorboards.
Timer starts.
You look around.

Start out the game like real life, as game progresses, it gets more alien.
When you pass a certain level you get a new kind of weapon.
Allow another player to steer the cockroach with keyboard/mouse.
Add gross flourescent lights that flicker on when it gets dark.
Add cockroaches to every surface in view.
	See how it looks.
	See how it looks in the rain.
Player has to clean up the carcasses.
	He cannot leave them there.
	Or they will dry up and blow around in the wind.
	He can pick them up with toilet paper.
		But sometimes the toilet paper can ªt carry 3 at a time.
Large roach gets killed, small roaches come out.
	Player is killed by smaller roaches.
Weapons
	Spit out fireballs (get the roach power)
Types of Roaches
	Spit out fireballs
